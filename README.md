## Project Description
In this project, I picked the data from stack overflow survey to better understand how developers work and if there is any difference regarding their mental health statements.
This project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree Program "Data Science".

## Motivation
It's an exploratory data analysis focused on ansewring the following questions:
* How many respondents work fully remotely compared to other groups?
* Is there a specific age group that works more remotely than others?
* Does the company size tell us something about the possibility to work remotely?
* Are there countries with a higher concentration of remote working developers?
* What role does years of coding experience play?
* Is there a difference in statements about mental health between fully remoter worker and in person worker?
I want to understand better who is actually working remote and if it's affecting mental health, since remote work gains more and more acceptance.

## Libraries Used
I used basic libraries like pandas, numpy and seaborn with python version 3.*.

## Data and File Description
About 70,000 developers told stack overflow about their work life.

I added one notebook with the main results I discovered.

## Results
I wrote some of the results down in the main notebook but you can also read about it in my blog post on medium here:
